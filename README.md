## Contents

### [`code/`](code/)
The [`code/`](code/) directory contains two subdirectories, [`exploration/`](code/exploration/) which contains R Markdown exploratory analyses, and [`scripts/`](code/scripts/) which contains all the code for cleaning, combining, and analysing the data.

Each `.R` script has a summary at the top of what it does. The scripts are numbered in the order in which they would typically be run. All `.Rmd` files in [`exploration/`](code/exploration/) are knitted to `github_documents` to make the GitHub repo browsable.
